"""
Feature-level explainability for Isolation Forest predictions.

Uses the fitted StandardScaler to compute how many standard deviations
each feature deviates from the normal training baseline.
Features with high deviation are the primary drivers of the anomaly flag.

This is mathematically grounded explainability - no black box,
no additional libraries required beyond what is already installed.
